SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT PLAN

Scope

Statement of Purpose
    What the application will do:    This application is an online food delivery app called 'Super Eats'. It enables users to order food from a variety of dishes from various cuisines. The final cart shows them what they have ordered along with the total cost. They can pay using credit/debit card, PayPal,cash on delivery. There is also an option to mention any additional requests such as spice levels, no onions etc. The application then asks for an address to which the food has to be delivered. It also gives the approximate time it would take for delivery.

    The problems this app solves and why I am developing it:   Food delivery apps have gained so much importance because of smartphone dependence. Nowadays people dont have time to go outside for food. Online ordering mainly solves mobility problems. Customers can order from anywhere - while sitting on a train, in a classroom, while working late from office. 
    Another problem it solves is the misunderstandings that occur when ordering via calling the restaurant directly. Restaurant noises, phone connectivity can lead to confusions which is avoided by online ordering as it is directly specified by the customer
    Customers have much so much more choice in an online food app, they can choose between different cuisines/dishes
    There is no minimum order quantity in this app. It doesnt matter if they can order for one, or order for a house party. 
    Restaurants during holiday times can get crowded and long waiting lines are usual. Order online from the comfort of home!

    Target audience:    Hungry? Busy...or lazy to cook? Vegetarian/vegan friendly? This app appeals to people of all ages because it is so convenient, painless to order, and quick. Almost everyone knows how to use a smartphone. 

    How target audience will use it:    It is very easy to install as an app from either iOS or Android app store or can be accesed via browser too. They need to sign up with their email ids when they use the app for the first time after which they can easily log in whenever ordering. They can create a profile with their favourite cuisines saved for future use. The 'Menu' icon gives them the choices of cuisines which they initially choose, after which they have the individual dishes to choose from a range of entrees, mains and desserts. The prices are mentioned alongside the dishes. If the user has any requests such as wanting extra napkins, reducing spice levels etc, there is an 'additional requests' column where they can write it down. The 'cart' then shows the final order and price for payment.Finally, their delivery address is to be given. Once the payment is made, their order can be live tracked until collection.
